# Instant Transitions

Ever been annoyed at those pesky black screens whenever you go through a loading zone and wished the transition was more snappy? Well, I've got good news! With this mod, your loading times won't just be fast: they'll be instant! In fact, it's so quick that whenever you go through one, it'll look like you took a video of it and spliced it to remove the loading time. It seems like a small thing, but it can really add up over the course of a playthrough.

## Alpha Notice

This mod is currently in alpha, which means it's fairly stable but there may be some bugs I missed or it may be lacking polish in some areas. I need your help to get it to a full release. If you find a bug or notice something that you want to see added or tweaked, please submit an issue to this repository.
